## Description

This website was created as a homework assignment for the University of Richmond coding boot camp. The task was to implement a weather dashboard that pulled data from the openweathermap.org API and displayed relevant data for a searched city. While working on this project, I learned a lot about how server-side APIs work and how to interpret the data they provide.

## Installation

## Usage

Visit the website at https://madchazo.github.io/HW6-weather-dashboard/. Use the input field to search for a city, which will then be added to your search history for easy reuse. Please note that the API may not have data for that specific city, so the area displayed beside the date at the top of the page is the area being used for reference. The five-day forecast will appear beneath the current day's forecast, and will be for the same time each day as the time for the current day's forecast.
